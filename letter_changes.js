//Using the JavaScript language, 
//have the function LetterChanges(str) take the str parameter being passed 
//and modify it using the following algorithm. 
//Replace every letter in the string with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a). 
//Then capitalize every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and finally return this modified string. 

//First, get the character code of the letters and add 1.

//For n < 26, if you add 97 to n, it's lower case. 65 to uppercase.
//Example: n = 65 for 'A'
